    <h1>Folktale: The Origin of Lake Toba</h1>
    <p>Welcome to Edukasu, a fun and meaningful place to learn! Today, we will learn a famous folktale from Sumatra Island, Indonesia, called <strong>"The Origin of Lake Toba."</strong></p>

    <h2>Story Summary</h2>
    <p>Once upon a time in Sumatra Island, there was a handsome man named <strong>Batara Guru Sahala</strong> who loved fishing. One day, he caught a fish. He was surprised when the fish talked and begged to be set free. He set the fish free, and suddenly the fish turned into a very beautiful woman. They got married happily, but Batara Guru Sahala promised never to tell anyone that she had been a fish.</p>

    <p>Years later, they had a son. One day, Batara Guru Sahala got angry with his son and called him “fish children.” The boy cried and told his mother. The mother was very angry because Batara Guru Sahala broke his promise. Then, the earth started to shake, and volcanoes erupted. A big hole appeared and became a lake. That lake is now known as <strong>Lake Toba</strong>.</p>
